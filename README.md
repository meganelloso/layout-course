# layout-course

Hi, this is my first repo as I aspire to be a developer. This is a responsive web design from designcode.io.
You could look into this link to look into the UI design: https://www.figma.com/file/5OcLVT4lqdl2EdtBsD5chc/D%2BC-CSS-Layout-and-Animations-Course?node-id=0%3A1.
I used mainly scss to code the output.

Hope you appreciate my work!
